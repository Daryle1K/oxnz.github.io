The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural language text.
>
The goal of the OpenNLP project will be to create a mature toolkit for the abovementioned tasks. An additional goal is to provide a large number of pre-built models for a variety of languages, as well as the annotated text resources that those models are derived from.
>
The Apache OpenNLP library contains several components, enabling one to build a full natural language processing pipeline.

* sentence detector
* tokenizer,
* name finder, 
* document categorizer, 
* part-of-speech tagger, 
* chunker, 
* parser, 
* coreference resolution


### interface

* API

```java
try (InputStream modelIn = new FileInputStream("lang-model-name.bin")) {
  SomeModel model = new SomeModel(modelIn);
  ToolName toolName = new ToolName(model);
  String output[] = toolName.executeTask("example text");
}
```

* CLI

```shell
opennlp ToolName
opennlp ToolName help
opennlp ToolName lang-model-name.bin < input.txt > output.txt
```
