## Messages

```
------------
   header
------------
  optional
 descriptors
------------
    body
------------
```

* header (fixed-size) destination, size(header+body)
* body (variable-sized) containing kernel and user data
	* contains descriptors of additional port rights to transmitted
	* descriptors of 'out-of-line' memory regions to be sent and a variable amount of user data
* trailer (variable-sized) kernel appended message attributes

## Mach Ports

`lsmp` list mach ports

* kernel maintained **message queue**
* multiple sender, single receiver

## Port Rights

In userspace, mach port names name rights a process has over a particular message queue.

* send right: enqueue an unlimited number of messages to a particular message queue
* send-once right: enqueue a single message
* receive right: dequeue an unlimited number of messages
* portset right: dequeue an unlimited number of messages from multiple message queues
* dead-name right: do nothing (no longer has a receiver)

for kernel owned ports for the kernel MIG apis, the messages never get queued, there's a fast path which turns them into synchronous syscalls (`ipc_kobject_server`)

Properties

* Port rights can be transferred between tasks via messages
* Tasks can receive messages from ports and port sets
* Tasks manipulate port sets with a port set name
* A port may not belong to more than one port set
* If a port is a member of a port set, the holder of the receive right cannot receive directly from the port
* Port rights are a secure, location-independent way of naming ports
* Port rights do not carry any location information
* Each task has its own space of port rights.
* Port rights are named with unsigned integers.
* `sizeof(mach_port_t) = sizeof(mach_port_name_t) = sizeof(void*)`
* `MACH_PORT_NULL(0)`
* `MACH_PORT_DEAD(~0)`

### Three basic rights

1. receive rights
2. send rights
3. send-once rights

* A port name can name any of these types of rights, or name a port-set, be a dead name, or name nothing.
* Dead names act as place-holders to prevent a name from being otherwise used.
* A port is destroyed, or dies, when its receive right is de-allocated.
