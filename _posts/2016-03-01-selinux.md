## SELinux Related Concepts

Subjects
: programs

Objects
: files that accessed by programs

Policy
: access control

* targeted - Targeted processes are protected.
* minimum - Modification of targeted policy. Only selected processes are protected.
* mls - Multi Level Security protection.

Mode
: Enforcing or Permissive or Disabled. Use `setenforce` to change mode and `setenforce` to verify it.

* enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
* permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
* disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.

View SELinux Status:

```shell
sestatus -v
```

## SELinux Map

	unix users(root,toor)
		|
		| 1:1
		v
	SELinux Identities(unconfined_u, user_u)
		|
		| 1:N
		v
	SELinux Roles(unconfined_r, sysadm_r, user_r)
		|
		| 1:1
		v
	SELinux Domains(sysadm_t, user_t)

## Process

	user login
		|
		| assign default security context
		v
	user
		|
		| inherited by
		v
	process1, process2 ...

## Policy

	operations
		|
		| check against policy
		v
	authorized|forbidden

### Standard policies

* targeted
* strict

## Security Context

* user identity
* role
* domain

{% highlight text %}
          role
domain1 <-------> domain2

       identity
role1 <---------> role2
{% endhighlight %}

Rights is associated with domains. domains is also a type.

dedicated domain:

sshd: sshd_exec_t -> sshd_t

DAC
: Descretionary Access Control

MAC
: Mandatory Access Control

MCS
: Multi Category Security

LSM
: Linux Security Module
